# Jenkins notes

## Users
These are regular users to access your jenkins installation.

## Credentials
These are credentials to access different services such as dockerhub or other services related to the plugins you may need.

## Basic config
You can set port and Git plugins config (user.name/user.email)
as well as Github connection
### GitHub
Create a token in GitHub with these options at least:
admin:repo_hook - for managing hooks (read, write and delete old ones)
repo - to see private repos
repo:status - to manipulate commit statuses

The token must be added as a credential, just like a secret text with an arbitrary id and description

### Email
You can also set SMTP for email delivery. For example, you could set up gmail with these data:
- Gmail SMTP server address: smtp.gmail.com
- Gmail SMTP user name: Your full Gmail address (e.g. example@gmail.com)
- Gmail SMTP password: Your Gmail password
- Gmail SMTP port: 465
- Gmail SMTP TLS/SSL required: yes
