# Jenkins notes

## Users
These are regular users to access your jenkins installation.

## Credentials
These are credentials to access different services such as dockerhub or other services related to the plugins you may need.

## Basic config
You can set port and Git plugins config (user.name/user.email)
as well as Github connection
Create a token in GitHub with these options at least:
admin:repo_hook - for managing hooks (read, write and delete old ones)
repo - to see private repos
repo:status - to manipulate commit statuses

The token must be added as a credential, just like a secret text with an arbitrary id and description
